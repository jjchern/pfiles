# About

This package is for personal use. It contains functions that automatically add [my template files](https://github.com/jjchern/tempt) to an R project. The package aims to solve the following problem:

- Problem: I have some template files, such as `.bibtex` or `macro.sty`, that I want to include in a new folder. Sometime I just need one template file, and sometime I need a few of them. A simple copy and paste will do it, but how can I automate it?
